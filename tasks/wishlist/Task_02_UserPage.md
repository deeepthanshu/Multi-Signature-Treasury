# Task 02: User Page and Registration Flow

## 1. Task Overview
**Implement a comprehensive user registration and authentication flow with a dedicated User Page, utilizing nonce-based authentication and addressing wallet connection bugs.**

### Problem Statement
- **Current Issue**: Users experience authentication bugs when initially connecting their wallet on new devices
- **Missing UX**: No dedicated user registration flow or user management page
- **Authentication Gap**: The current system auto-creates users but doesn't handle the authentication flow properly for new devices
- **State Management**: User state is managed but lacks proper registration/onboarding flow

### Solution Overview
- **User Registration Modal**: Simple, intuitive registration flow for new users
- **Nonce-Based Authentication**: Secure authentication using wallet signature verification
- **User Page**: Dedicated page for user profile management and settings
- **Bug Resolution**: Fix wallet connection authentication issues on new devices

## 2. Requirements

### User Stories
```
As a new user, I want to register my wallet securely so that I can access the multisig platform
As an existing user, I want to authenticate on a new device so that I can access my wallets and data
As a user, I want to manage my profile and settings so that I can customize my experience
As a user, I want a smooth wallet connection experience so that I don't encounter authentication bugs
As a user, I want to see human-readable names (AdaHandles) instead of long wallet addresses so that I can easily identify users
As a user, I want the system to find my account using either my wallet address or stake key so that I can access my data regardless of which identifier I have
```

- **FR-8**: Stake Key Flexibility - Support user lookup by both address and stake key for better wallet compatibility

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Security - Cryptographic signature verification for all authentication
- **NFR-2**: UX/UI - Intuitive, modern interface following existing design patterns
- **NFR-3**: Performance - Fast authentication flow with minimal loading states

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React components with TypeScript, Zustand state management
- **Authentication**: Nonce-based signature verification using Mesh SDK
- **Backend**: Existing tRPC API with JWT token management
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with existing User and Nonce models

### API Specifications
**Existing Endpoints to Utilize:**
- `GET /api/v1/getNonce?address={address}` - Request nonce for address
- `POST /api/v1/authSigner` - Verify signature and get JWT token
- `api.user.getUserByAddress` - Get user by address
- `api.user.getUserByStakeKey` - Get user by stake key for better flexibility
- `api.user.createUser` - Create new user

**New Endpoints Needed:**
- `api.user.updateUser` - Update user profile information
- `api.user.deleteUser` - Delete user account (optional)

### Database Schema
**Existing Models:**
```prisma
model User {
  id           String @id @default(cuid())
  address      String @unique
  stakeAddress String @unique
  nostrKey     String @unique
  discordId    String @default("")
}

model Nonce {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  address   String   @unique
  value     String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

**Potential Additions:**
- displayName field for user-friendly names
- email field for contact information
- lastLoginAt timestamp for activity tracking
- isActive boolean for account status
- preferences JSON field for user settings

### Integration Points
- **Mesh SDK**: Wallet connection and signature verification
- **Zustand Store**: User state management and persistence
- **tRPC**: API communication and type safety
- **Next.js**: Routing and page management
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication
- **AdaHandle API**: Name resolution for human-readable wallet identification

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Development Phases (UI-First Approach)
- **Phase 1**: User Registration Modal UI (Week 1)
  - Create registration modal component with mock data
  - Design nonce-based authentication flow UI
  - Implement modal states and transitions
  - Basic zustand store integration
- **Phase 2**: User Profile Page UI (Week 2)
  - Create user profile page layout and components
  - Design user settings interface
  - Implement profile display with mock data
  - Add navigation and routing
- **Phase 3**: UI Polish and Integration (Week 3)
  - Refine user experience and interactions
  - Add loading states and error handling
  - Connect to existing wallet connection flow
  - Minimal API integration for essential features

### Dependencies
- **External**: Mesh SDK for wallet connection (minimal integration)
- **Internal**: Zustand user store, existing UI components, mock data
- **Infrastructure**: No database changes needed initially
