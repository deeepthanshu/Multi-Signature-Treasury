3. **Reference requirements**: AI can read task files and provide context-aware suggestions

#### For VS Code Users
1. **Install markdown extensions**: Use "Markdown Preview Enhanced" for better task viewing
2. **Use TODO extensions**: Track requirements as TODOs in your code
3. **Workspace setup**: Configure workspace with tasks and code side-by-side

#### For Other IDEs
- **JetBrains**: Use built-in markdown preview and TODO tracking
- **Vim/Neovim**: Use markdown preview plugins and split windows
- **Any IDE**: Keep task files open in tabs or side panels while coding

### Task Template Usage

The `Task_template.md` provides a comprehensive structure for documenting:
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Specifications**: API specs, database schema, integration points
- **Implementation Plan**: Development phases and dependencies
- **Testing Strategy**: Test cases and acceptance criteria
- **Code Analysis**: Key issues and implementation details

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Tasks Updated**: Update task documentation as requirements evolve
2. **Link Code to Tasks**: Use commit messages and code comments that reference task sections
3. **Version Control**: Commit task updates alongside related code changes
4. **AI Integration**: Leverage AI assistants to help implement task requirements
5. **Regular Reviews**: Review and update tasks during development sprints

### Integration with Development Tools

- **Git**: Link task sections to specific commits and pull requests

```

**Example VS Code Setup:**
```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "markdown.preview.breaks": true,
  "todo-tree.general.tags": ["FR-", "NFR-", "TC-"],
  "files.associations": {
    "Task_*.md": "markdown"
  }
}
```

#### JetBrains IDEs
```bash
# 1. Use built-in markdown preview
# 2. Set up TODO patterns for task requirements
# 3. Use the TODO tool window to track progress
# 4. Link commits to task sections
```

### Task Management Best Practices

#### 1. **Task Lifecycle**
```
[Planning] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Complete]
     ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
  Create     Update        Validate   Archive
  Task       Progress      Against    Task
             Notes         Criteria   Notes
```

#### 2. **Progress Tracking**
```markdown
# In your task file, update status like this:
## Implementation Status
- [x] FR-1: User authentication (COMPLETED - 2024-01-15)
- [ ] FR-2: API integration (IN PROGRESS - 2024-01-16)
- [ ] FR-3: Frontend implementation (PENDING)
```

#### 3. **Code Integration**
```typescript
/**
 * Implements FR-1: User Authentication
 * Task: Task_01_Integration.md
 * Requirements: Functional Requirements section
 * Status: COMPLETED
 */
export class AuthService {
  // Implementation here
}
```

#### 4. **Commit Messages**
```bash
# Reference task sections in commits
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication (Task_01_Integration.md - FR-1)"
git commit -m "fix: resolve API integration issue (Task_01_Integration.md - Technical Specs)"
git commit -m "test: add test cases for user journey (Task_01_Integration.md - TC-1)"
```

### Collaboration Guidelines

#### 1. **Team Workflow**
- **Assign tasks** to team members with clear ownership
- **Review tasks** before starting implementation
- **Update progress** regularly in task files
- **Link pull requests** to specific task requirements

#### 2. **Code Reviews**
```markdown
# In PR descriptions, reference tasks:
## Changes Made
- Implements FR-1: User authentication (Task_01_Integration.md)
- Addresses NFR-2: Performance requirements (Task_01_Integration.md)
- Includes tests for TC-1, TC-2 (Task_01_Integration.md)

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for authentication service
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Manual testing of user flows
```

#### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- **Keep tasks current** as requirements evolve
- **Add implementation notes** to task files
- **Document architectural decisions** made during development
- **Update acceptance criteria** based on new insights

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Q: How do I handle changing requirements?**
A: Update the task file with the new requirements and document the changes. Use version control to track requirement evolution.

**Q: What if a task is too large?**
A: Break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Create sub-tasks or split into multiple task files.

**Q: How do I link code to specific requirements?**
A: Use code comments, commit messages, and PR descriptions that reference task sections (e.g., "FR-1", "TC-2").

**Q: Can I use external project management tools too?**
A: Yes, but keep the tasks directory as the source of truth for technical requirements. Sync with external tools as needed.

### Advanced Usage

#### 1. **Automated Task Validation**
```bash
# Create scripts to validate implementation against tasks
# Example: Check if all FR-* requirements are implemented
grep -r "FR-" tasks/ | while read line; do
  echo "Checking requirement: $line"
  # Add validation logic here
done
```

#### 2. **Task Templates for Different Types**
- **Feature Tasks**: Use full template for new features
- **Bug Fix Tasks**: Simplified template focusing on problem/solution
- **Refactoring Tasks**: Template emphasizing code quality and architecture

#### 3. **Integration with CI/CD**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Validate Task Requirements
  run: |
    # Check if implemented features match task requirements
    # Validate that all FR-* items are addressed
    # Ensure tests cover TC-* items
```

This comprehensive usage guide ensures that developers can effectively leverage the co-located tasks directory for improved development workflows and better integration with AI-powered coding assistants.
